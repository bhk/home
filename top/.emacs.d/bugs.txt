Bugs and Resolutions
====

TERM='' causes emacsclient to fail
--------------------------------

When TERM is an empty string, emacsclient fails to communicate with the
emacs server.

Resolution: Set TERM=emacs (instead of TERM='').


Wrong emacsclient in path
--------------------------------

When running /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs (version 25.3.1),
the emacsclient in PATH (/usr/bin/emacsclient, version 22.1) is not
compatible.  Instead, we should run
/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient.  [Also, etags,
ctags, and ebrowse live in this bin directory.]

Emacs *already* updates PATH to include the bin directory, but it places it
at the *end*, not at the start:
  PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/Emacs.app/...

Variables that reference paths in /Applications/Emacs.app:
  Info-default-directory-list has /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info.
  data-directory = /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/etc/
  doc-directory = /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/etc/
  exec-directory = /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/libexec/

Resolution:
  In init.el: move PATH entries for this version of emacs to the front.
